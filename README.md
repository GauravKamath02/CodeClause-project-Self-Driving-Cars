# Self-Driving Cars
The Self-Driving Cars Object Detection project uses advanced computer vision techniques to enable autonomous vehicles to identify and track various objects on the road, including bikers, pedestrians, cars, traffic lights of various colors, and even trucks, helping them navigate safely and efficiently.

## Description
The project utilizes a dataset from Udacity Self-Driving Car Challenge, which includes 30,000 images and 11 classes of objects, including bikers, cars, pedestrians, traffic lights, and trucks. The dataset is diverse and contains a wide range of scenarios and conditions, making it an excellent training set for the object detection model.

To train the object detection model, the project uses Yolov8, a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm that is specifically designed for object detection tasks. Yolov8 is highly efficient and can process images in real-time, making it an ideal choice for autonomous vehicle applications.

The trained model can accurately detect and classify different objects on the road, including traffic lights of various colors and subtypes, such as green left and red left arrows. The system can also detect trucks, often used for transporting goods.
